The 2 files, *_k.F, form the crux of the solvation model. 
The file interface_patch_535 is the patch file for linking *_k.F files to the original VASP code version 5.3.5.


PREREQUISITES
=============
VASP.5.3.5 source code.
Compiler and library requirements are the same as VASP.5.3.5.

INSTALL
========

1. Apply the interface patch to the original VASP source code.
   
	cd <VASP src directory>
	patch -p1 <path to the interface patch file>

2. After applying the patch, copy the other 2 files to the VASP src directory:

   	 git clone https://github.com/matk86/VASPsol <path to VASP src directory>

3. In the original VASP Makefile, put pot_lpcm_cav_k.o and pot_k.o object file names before pot.o in that order.

4. make clean

5. make


After installations, please see the test files available at http://vaspsol.mse.cornell.edu/
